Have to build an application that is secure and receives and plots sampled temperature and humidity readings from a sensor.
The sensor readings have been simulated so the data being plotted is taken from two text files holding the readings.

We decided to make a web application using visual studios. I developed the actual chart that plots the data and read the data files to get the points that were plotted.
